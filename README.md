# aws-es-update-notifier

Drops a notification in Slack if updates are available for AWS ElasticSearch clusters

## Purpose

AWS frequently releases updates for ElasticSearch but there is no way to receive a notification when an update is available, beyond randomly finding it in the console.

This solution is a scheduled lambda function which runs weekly and checks each ES cluster in the current region to see if it has an update pending.  If it does, a notification is sent to Slack with the details.

## Prerequsites

- python3 and pip3 must be installed
- You'll need to setup a [Slack bot](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/115005265703-Create-a-bot-for-your-workspace) and obtain the oAuth token for your bot.  The oAuth token is under Features->oAuth and Permissions.
- This oAuth token will need to be stored in [AWS parameter store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) as a secure string
- The Slack bot will need to be a member of the channel you wish to post to (`/invite @mybot`)
- You'll need the ID of the KMS key used to encrypt your SSM secure string parameter

## Installing

Everything is packaged with [aws sam](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/).  You'll want to install one application in each region you have ES clusters.  Clone this repo and run:

```bash
sam build

sam deploy \
    --stack-name es-update-notifier \
    --s3-bucket <an existing bucket to store lambda sam apps in> \
    --profile staging \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
     --parameter-overrides "SlackChannel=#alerts \
                            KMSDecryptSSMKeyID=abcdget-1234-e456-123455 \
                            SlackBotOAuthTokenSSMPath=/devops/slack/MYBOT_OAUTH_TOKEN"
```

Repeat the `sam deploy` for each region, ensuring that the KMS key ID and the SSM path are correct for each region.
